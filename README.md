# Kenya-7
My first game

COMMANDS
- Use QZSD to move (I have an azerty keyboard)
- Click left or right mouse button to shoot
- Click on the space button to jump

WARNING
- You have to launch the game via VSCode to get the textures to display
- I created a server for a future multiplayer function with node, but it is not ready yet
- There are still some bugs I'm working on (please don't try to reach the sky limits for example)
